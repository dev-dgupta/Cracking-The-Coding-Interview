The Apocalypse:
In the new post-apocalyptic world, the world queen is desperately concerned
about the birth rate. Therefore, she decrees that all families should ensure
that they have one girl or else they face massive fines. If all families abide
by this policy-that is, they have continue to have children until they have
one girl, at which point they immediately stop-what will the gender ratio of
the new generation be? ( Assume that the odds of someone having a boy or a girl
on any given pregnancy is equal.) Solve this out logically.

Solution:
Each family will have a sequence of zero or more boys followed by a single girl.
That is, if "G" indicates a girl and "B" indicates a boy, the sequence of children
will look like one of: G, BG, BBG, BBBG, BBBBG and so on.

P(G) = 1/2. That is, 50% of families will have a girl first. The others will go
        on to have more children.
P(BG) = 1/4 Of those who have a second child (which is 50%), 50% of them will
       have a girl the next time.
P(BBG) = 1/8 . Of those who have a third child (which is 25%), 50% of them will
        have a girl the next time.
And so on.

We know that every family has exactly one girl. The expected value of the number
of boys is the probability of each sequence multiplied by the number of boys in
that sequence. ~1. 

So, gender ratio is going to be 1:1.
