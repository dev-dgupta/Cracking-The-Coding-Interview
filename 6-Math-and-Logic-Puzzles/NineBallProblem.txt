The "nine balls" question is a classic interview question. You have nine balls. Eight are of the same weight,
and one is heavier. You are given a balance which tells you only whether the left side or the right side is
heavier. Find the heavy ball in just two uses of the scale.

Sol: If we divide the balls into sets of three items each, we will know after just one weighing which set has the
heavy one. For the final set of three balls, we simply repeat this: put one ball off to the side and weigh two.
Pick the heavier of the two. Or, if the balls are the same weight, pick the third one.
