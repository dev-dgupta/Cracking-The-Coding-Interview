Jugs of Water:
You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water ( but no
measuring cups ). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the
jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

Solution:
This question, like many puzzle questions, has a math/computer science root. If the two jug
sizes are relatively prime, you can measure any value between 'one and the sum of the jug sizes'.

5 Quart | 3 Quart | Action
------------------------
  5	   0        Filled 5-quart jug.
  2        3        Filled 3-quart with S-quart's contents.
  2        0        Dumped 3-quart.
  0        2        Fill 3-quart with S-quart's contents.
  5        2        Filled 5-quart.
  4        3        Fill remainder of 3-quart with 5-quart.
  4                 Done! We have 4 quarts.
