Ants on a Triangle:
There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of
collision (between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the
triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction, with either direction being
equally likely to be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed.

Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.

Solution:
The ants will not collide only if all of them are moving in same direction i.e.
clockwise or anti-clockwise.
All possible directions: {000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111}

P( same direction for 3 ants ) = 2/(2^3)

For ants on a n-vertex polygon: = 2/(2^n) = 1/2^(n-1)
