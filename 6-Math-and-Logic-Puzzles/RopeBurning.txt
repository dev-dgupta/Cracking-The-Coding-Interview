You have two ropes, and each takes exactly one hour to burn. How would you use them to time exactly 15
minutes? Note that the ropes are of uneven densities, so half the rope length-wise does not necessarily take
half an hour to burn.

Sol: Burn rope1 at both ends and rope2 at one end. When rope1 is completely burnt 30 mins would have
passed. Now burn rope2 at other end also. The time elapsed since rope2 started burning from other end
is 15 min.
