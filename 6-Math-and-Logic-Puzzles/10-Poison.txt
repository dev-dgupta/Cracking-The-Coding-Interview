Poison:
You have 1000 bottles of soda, and exactly one is poisoned. You have latest strips which
can be used to detect poison. A single drop of poison will turn the test strip positive 
permanently. You can put any number of drops on a test strip at once and you can reuse a
test strip as many times as you'd like (as long as the results are negative). However, you
can only run tests once per day and it takes seven days to return a result. How would you
figure out the poisoned bottle in as few days as possible?

Solution:
Optimal Approach (7 days)
Notice what each test strip really means. It's a binary indicator for poisoned or unpoisoned.
Is it possible to map 1000 keys to 10 binary values such that each key is mapped to a unique
configuration of values? Yes, of course. This is what a binary number is. We can take each
bottle number and look at its binary representation. If there's a 1 in the ith digit, then we
will add a drop of this bottle's contents to test strip i. Observe that 2^10 is 1024, so 10
test strips will be enough to handle up to 1024 bottles.
We wait seven days, and then read the results. If test strip i is positive, then set bit i
of the result value. Reading all the test strips will give us the ID of the poisoned bottle.
