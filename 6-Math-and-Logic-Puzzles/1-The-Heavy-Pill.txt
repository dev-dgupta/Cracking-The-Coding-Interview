The Heavy Pill:
You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight
1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy
bottle? You can only use the scale once.

Solution:
Take 1 pill from bottle 1
     2 pill from bottle 2
     3 pill from bollte 3
     ...
     19 pill from bottle 19
     20 pill from bottle 20

sum upto n = n*(n+1)/2.

The total weight should be 210 + 0.1*( bottle-no ).
